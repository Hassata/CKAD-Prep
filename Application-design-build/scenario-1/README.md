Scenario 1: Creating a custom web application image:

Simple Flask App (GitHub): You can use this basic Flask application as a starting point: https://github.com/pallets/flask/tree/main/examples/basic-app

Practice: Write a Dockerfile that selects a base image, installs dependencies, copies the application into the image, and defines the command to start the application. Build the image and run it locally to ensure the application works as expected.
